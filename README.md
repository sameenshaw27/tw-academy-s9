## Italics

Use italics to emphasize a word or group of words. For example:
Al least two reviews are required before you check in your code.
You must not enter without your ID card.

IMPORTANT: Use this style sparingly to avoid diluting its strength.

Use a fixed font to highlight:
Commands or pieces of code. For example:
Run the npm install text-cli command to install the utility.
File or folder names. For example:
Read the README.md file before you proceed.
